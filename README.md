Our project is an analysis of crime trends in Washington State, focusing on patterns in the Eastern and Western regions. Our project goal is to inform strategic decision-making and policy development for the enhancement of public safety. We will be using a number of research questions to guide our investigation, such as the evolution of crime rates from 2020 to 2022 in Eastern and Western Washington, disparities in crime statistics between these regions, prevalence of specific crime types, and the impact of urbanization and population size on crime rates. 

Our project's significance is its potential to fill gaps in understanding about Washington State's regional variations and facilitate collaboration between our audience of law enforcement, policymakers, researchers, and the public while considering the unique socio-economic, cultural, and geographic factors influencing crime dynamics in Eastern and Western Washington. Our findings are expected to benefit law enforcement agencies by providing insights into regional crime patterns, assisting policymakers in formulating evidence-based policies, aiding researchers in deepening their understanding of regional crime trends, and informing the general public about the safety of their respective regions. 
To visually convey our insights, we have included a figure depicting a comparative analysis of crime rates in Eastern and Western Washington over the last three years, providing a snapshot of our comprehensive study.
